# AutoGemUpdater

Auto Gem Updater helps you to keep your gems, up to date.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'auto_gem_updater'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install auto_gem_updater

## Configuration

Configuration options are: `pre_checks, outdated_options, ignore_gems`

To config these options add a file to your `config/initializers` and call it `auto_gem_updater.rb`
This file should look like:
```ruby
AutoGemUpdater.configure do |config|
  config.pre_checks = ['bundle exec rspec']
end
```
each of the options above can be configured inside the above block (e.g `config.pre_checks = ['bundle exec rspec']`)

#### pre_checks
`pre_checks` is expected to be an array of all the checks you want performed before an update to a gem is commit. The default is an empty array.

For example `['bundle exec rspec', 'bundle exec rake routes',...]`

#### outdated_options
`outdated_options` is expected to be an array of options that you want to be passed to `bundle outdated` any of the options form the [docs](https://bundler.io/man/bundle-outdated.1.html) are supported. The default is `['strict']`.

For example `['strict', 'minor']`

#### ignore_gems
`ignore_gems` is expected to be an array of gems that you do not want the auto gem updater to attempt to update. The default is an empty array.

For example `['nokogiri', 'rails',...]`

## Usage

Once the gem is installed it will add to some rake tasks that will allow you to update your gems.

#### Update
`rake auto_gem_updater:update` is the main rake task. It will first create a branch, called `auto_gem_updates_ + todays date`. It will then loop over all the gems that it finds out of date according to the outdated_options each time running all the pre_checks specified in the initializer and only if they succeed add the updated gem version to git (otherwise it resets to before trying to update the gem).

#### Outdated
`rake auto_gem_updater:outdated` will list out all the gems that the update command will attempt to update.
